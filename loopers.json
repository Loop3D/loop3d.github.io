      "descr": "<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernanda-alvarado-neves-29636b96/'>Fernanda Alvarada</a> is a geologist with an MSc from the University of Chile, and is currently a PhD candidate at Monash University.  Fernanda’s master thesis focused on understanding the tectonic evolution of the Western Principal Andes Cordillera in Central Chile during the Cenozoic era. After completing her masters, she worked a few years in mineral exploration and mine geology of large Porphyry Cu deposits. Fernanda’s PhD project aims to develop an innovative method to model igneous intrusions, which will be part of LoopStructural. This method will integrate ground-breaking 3D modelling methods and constraints from intrusion emplacement mechanisms to reproduce realistic intrusion shapes."

      "descr": "<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabii-chaarani/'>Rabii Chaarani</a>'s thesis project is focused on the assessment of the value of structural data of poly-deformed terranes and will address the issue of data representativity and data sparsity/density. The objective of his PhD thesis is to test the sensitivity of the Loop Structural Modelling Engine to data distributions during the modelling of polydeformed terranes. To do this, he will develop a data sampling workflow based upon field-collected data over the Eldee structure in Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia."

      "descr": "<a href='https://users.monash.edu/~jdroniou/'>Jerome Droniou's</a> area of expertise is the design and mathematical analysis of numerical schemes for porous media flows. He is interested in numerical methods for non-linear models (including multi-phase flows in fractured media) and in establishing their mathematical properties - including convergence without assuming non-physical properties on the data. The methods developed are applicable to meshes with generic polytopes as elements. In LOOP, Jerome has been contributing to designing new discrete implicit modelling methods for approximating implicit functions used to represent geological objects within geological models."
